That&amp;rsquo;s what it is. Nonetheless, we can make it do things you want.
Install conda.
Don&amp;rsquo;t install anaconda unless you are also a bitch. Install miniconda. Pick Linux &amp;gt; Miniconda3 Linux 64-bit unless, like I said, you are a little baby. Say yes to conda init.
Fix default things that conda does
Close your terminal and open another, or source ~.bashrc or wherever you have bashrc.</description></item><item><title>Graeme and Courtney's Wedding</title><link>https://smithandrewk.github.io/posts/graeme-wedding/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithandrewk.github.io/posts/graeme-wedding/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Movie Rankings</title><link>https://smithandrewk.github.io/posts/emoji-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithandrewk.github.io/posts/emoji-support/</guid><description>Here is a list of movies I&amp;rsquo;ve watched (not all) with ratings and comments.
