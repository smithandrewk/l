It is important to note that one of the greatest mathematicians (Erdos) was not convinced until he was shown a Monte Carlo simulation of the problem. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case that Erdos did not understand the explanations by enumeration and so on.</description></item><item><title>What the f*** is docker</title><link>https://smithandrew.com/dev/docker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithandrew.com/dev/docker/</guid><description>Docker is a saint. That&amp;rsquo;s what it is.
1. Install Docker sudo apt install docker.io If you don&amp;rsquo;t have sudo access or apt package manager, find another tutorial.

Let \(M \in \R^{2\times 2} \). There exists \(U,S,V\) such that
In simple terms, the SVD breaks a matrix down into it&amp;rsquo;s fundamental components. Often, a matrix is easier to understand if we can decompose it into fundamental components.
$$\displaystyle M = U\Sigma V^T.$$
Shown here is the transformation diagram of a singular value decomposition.</description></item><item><title>What the f*** is conda</title><link>https://smithandrew.com/dev/conda/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithandrew.com/dev/conda/</guid><description>Install conda.
Install miniconda. Pick Linux &amp;gt; Miniconda3 Linux 64-bit unless you are a little baby. Say yes to conda init.
Fix default things that conda does
Close your terminal and open another, or source ~.bashrc or wherever you have bashrc. Prevent conda from activating base environment by default conda config --set auto_activate_base false Checkout base packages conda list If you had installed anaconda, you&amp;rsquo;d have 6 million base packages.</description></item></channel></rss>
