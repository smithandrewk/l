Let \(M \in \R^{2\times 2} \). There exists \(U,S,V\) such that
In simple terms, the SVD breaks a matrix down into it&amp;rsquo;s fundamental components. Often, a matrix is easier to understand if we can decompose it into fundamental components.
$$\displaystyle M = U\Sigma V^T.$$
Shown here is the transformation diagram of a singular value decomposition.</description></item><item><title>What the f*** is conda</title><link>https://smithandrew.com/dev/conda/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithandrew.com/dev/conda/</guid><description>Conda is a bitch. That&amp;rsquo;s what it is. Nonetheless, we can make it do things you want.
Install conda.
Don&amp;rsquo;t install anaconda unless you are also a bitch. Install miniconda. Pick Linux &amp;gt; Miniconda3 Linux 64-bit unless, like I said, you are a little baby. Say yes to conda init.
Fix default things that conda does
Close your terminal and open another, or source ~.bashrc or wherever you have bashrc.</description></item><item><title>April Gigs Bring May Flowers</title><link>https://smithandrew.com/posts/april-gigs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithandrew.com/posts/april-gigs/</guid><description>Thanks to Zenas, one of my best friends, for offering me a few gigs in April.
